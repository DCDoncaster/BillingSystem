    * password: a string with a user defined password of up to 45 characters
    * fullname: first and last name of the user 
    * lastreading: Sent as a whole number integer. This will not generate any charges and shoudl be used to generate a base line for any future charges
    * outstandingbalance : Should always be set to 0 unless the customer is being provided an opening credit on their account
    * phonenumber: Should be provided as a String


* /user/read - **GET**
  * Provides a list of all users as a raw database extract - no parameters are required for this request

    * fullname: first and last name of the user 
    * phonenumber: provided as a string
    * lastreading: provided as a whole number integer - this will trigger an update of the reading held on the customers file and also update their account balance.The customer will also receive a text message if we hold a number on file for them to confirm their up to date balance
      * If a reading is provided this will also updated into the readings table with todays date and the customers account number
      * When a new balance is calculated the customer will also be sent a notification of their new balance by SMS Text Message provided that a valid mobile number exists in their account.
